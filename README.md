## Overview

This project investigates how different **geo-social media topic categories** (e.g., symptoms, prevention measures, vaccines) contribute to the **early warning of COVID-19 case dynamics** across U.S. states, and how these early warning capabilities vary with **state-level political leaning**.

The repository provides:
- Preprocessed datasets used in the analysis (no raw Tweets)
- Scripts for constructing topic-specific geo-social media signals
- Statistical analysis and evaluation code
- Materials needed to reproduce the main figures and results reported in the paper

The focus is on **spatio-temporal lead–lag relationships** between geo-social media activity and reported COVID-19 cases.
